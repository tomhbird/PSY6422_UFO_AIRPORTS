# PSY6422_UFO_AIRPORTS
Investigating whether there is a relationship between UFO sightings in mainland USA and major airport locations. The raw UFO data was sourced from the NUFORC website, and processed by Sigmond Axel to include geolocated and time standardized reports, which is publicly accessible on github https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports. The locations of major US airports was acquired from data.world and sourced from OurAirports https://data.world/ourairports/989444cc-447b-4030-a866-57fcd6c2d3ee. This dataset includes all North American airports, and is publicly accessible.

I created a map which visualises the spread of UFO sightings in regard to major US airport locations, and a stacked bargraph which shows the average duration of these sighting in regard to the shape observed.
